# Time-out-UART-project-8051
projects on 8051 microcontroller 

By using virtual terminal we give input to 8051 microcontroller. when it receive 5 bytes & time span between any two receptions is
equal to or more than 1 sec blink the LED connected to P1.0, 5 times & stop the reception , when time span between all two receptions
is less than 1 sec  transmitt it back through UART and yellow led blink 5 times. by using switch we reset and start the reception.
